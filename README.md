Cute-a-pult
===================

This project is part of a tutorial I wrote for [Ray Wenderlich's site](http://www.raywenderlich.com/).

You can see the first part of the tutorial [here](http://www.raywenderlich.com/4756/how-to-make-a-catapult-shooting-game-with-cocos2d-and-box2d-part-1). The second part is coming soon.
